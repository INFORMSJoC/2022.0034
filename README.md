The software and data in this repository are a snapshot of the software and data
that were used in the research reported on in the paper 
*An Algorithm for maximizing a convex function based on its minimum* by Aharon Ben-Tal and Ernst Roos

## Cite

The final version of this repository, with updated bibliographical information, is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/INFORMSJoC/2022.0034).

## Description

The goal of this software is to maximize convex functions over a convex feasible set.

The software is written in MATLAB and uses the publically available YALMIP package 
(https://yalmip.github.io/), and the MOSEK solver (https://www.mosek.com/). For the latter,
free academic licenses are available.

## Usage

The software can be ran via the `RunInstances` function that takes a directory name as
input. It will solve all instances in the specified folder. Instances should be provided
as ".mat" files with two variables with the following specification:
* objective - Structure that describes the objective through these fields:
  * f         - Function handle that evaluates the objective function at a given input x.
  * grad      - Function handle that evaluates the gradient of the objective function at a given input x.
* feasible_set - Structure that describes the feasible set through these fields:
  * max_linear        - Function that maximizes a linear function with the first argument as coefficients over the feasible set and returns the optimal solution. 
  * random_boundary   - Function that returns a random point on the boundary of the feasible set.
  * n                 - Dimension of the feasible set.
  
For example, running 
`RunInstances("..\Data\Table 1\")`
will run all instances used to generate the results in Table 4, which will output the following:
```
Processing Instance 1
------------------------------------------------
Best Value found: 394.751 
Total time spent: 2.241

```
as well as the content of Table 4.
  
## Replicating

To replicate the results in any of the tables in the paper, simply run the "RunInstances"  
function on the relevant sub directory in the instances directory.
